#### **Discrete time logistic growth model**
_This equation studies the population growth in the environment and its carrying capacity_
n[t] = n[t-1] + ( r * n[t-1] * (K - n[t-1])/K )

* n[t] = abundance
*  n[t â€“ 1] = abundance of the population in the previous time step
* r = intrinsic growth rate 
* K = carrying capacity 

Then we made a plot for the abundance data.
