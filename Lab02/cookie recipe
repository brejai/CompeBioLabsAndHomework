    2 cups raw unsalted cashews

    1/2 cup cacao powder

    1/4 cup pure maple syrup

    2 tablespoons melted virgin coconut oil

    1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract
    1/8 teaspoon Celtic sea salt 

    Throw all of the ingredients into a food processor fitted with the s blade, and and pulse until the mixture forms a ball.

    Place the mixture between two pieces of parchment paper and with a rolling pin, flatten the batter into an even 1/4-inch layer.

    Using a small 1-inch round cookie cutter (or the top of a shot glass), cut the batter into small circles. The batter should make about 60 small cookies
